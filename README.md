# Flickerfly's k3ng_keyer
This is my fork of the K3NG Arduino CW Keyer project with my modifications. 

You can find the official version at https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_cw_keyer.

My modifications include support for Adafruit's I2C/SPI LCD backpack and then various settings that amount to uncommenting the right thing to turn on features I'm using.
